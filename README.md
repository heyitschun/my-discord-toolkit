# Chun's Discord Toolkit

Simple bot to check stuff in your server to make sure there is not shady shit going on.

- Warns server admins if *administrator* permissions have been granted to another role
- Warns server admins if *manage server* permissions have been granted to a role
- Quickly see all members and bots with administrator permissions
- Quickly see all server members who failed to gain a role within after 21 days of joining

## WIP
- Add Discord users to a blacklist by their userID (they are banned as soon as they join the server)
